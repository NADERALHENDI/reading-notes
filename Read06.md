# 1. How makes a computer, a computer ?
If a machine could be designed and built to help us with the thincking work we do,
it would need to be designed to manipolate information.
   - it would need to take input
   - store information
   - process it, and output the results.
# 2. Binary & Data:
- In the `decimal` number system, we have ten digits from 0 to 9.
- In the `binary` number system, we only have two digits: *zero* and *one*.
- In the computer: text, images, and sounds be represented with numbers.
#### Images are made out of teeny dots called `pixels`, each pixel has a color,and each color can be represented with numbers.
#### The typical vedio shows 30 images pes second.
#### The sound: 
   - is basically a series of vibrations in the air.
   - vibrations can be represented graphically as a waveform.
   - any point on this waveform can be represented by a number.
# 3. Hardware and Software:
   - `Hardware:` is the physical parts of a computer like: circuits, wires, chips...etc
   - `Software:` it is what you don't see like: computer programs, code...etc
