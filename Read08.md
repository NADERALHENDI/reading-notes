# 1. Comparison operators:
we use it to evaluate conditions, and the result will be a Boolean: `true` or `false`.

# 2. Logical operators

##### there is another logical operator which is:
##### *logical not:* (!)
ex: !(2 < 1) = true
# LOOPS:
- Loops check a condition. if it true, a code will run.
- then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns `true`, the code block will run again.
- it repeats until the condition returns `false`.
### TYPES OF LOOPING:
1. *For*: use it when you know how many times will repeat the code block.
2. *while*: use it when you don't know how many times will repeat the code block.
3. *Do while*.
